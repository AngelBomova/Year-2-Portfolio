      <p class="hone homecol2">Hi! My name is Angel and hopefully this is the second portofolio of mine that you are
        viewing. I am now 16 years old and I am currently a Junior in highschool and an upcoming Senior (I feel old).
        Some hobbies I have include shooting hoops, working out, watching YouTube (shout out Ryan Trahan), relaxing with
        cats and dog, and playing whatever random game with my friends! If you were wondering, those are my three
        beautiful pets on the left :) <br> <br>

      <p class="hone homecol2"> Something I am really passionate about is web designing. It is a fun yet challenging
        course figuring out how to edit and create websites with the use of HTML, CSS, and JS. What makes this class
        special is the creativity you have with it! In my second year I think I really polished a lot of my skills and
        definitely got better with CSS. Something I need to work on is JS, because I still struggle with coding it and
        knowing how to add it into a project. Another thing that I improved with was Photoshop, getting a better feel
        for it and using it a lot more this year for my projects. Overall I definitely improved on my skills overall,
        and click through the page to see examples of my recent works!
